# Microservice
This microservice uses Flask. It takes an array and will pick a random number from the array. It will then remove the random number from the array. Then it will return the new array. It has an endpoint url to recieve the array(Will need to be adjusted with host location). After finding the array, it will convert the data into JSON format. (It uses request_data, so you have to change the ['array'] in array = req_data['array'] to whatever the array is called. It will then return the new array into JSON format.
