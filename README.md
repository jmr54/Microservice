# Microservice
This microservice uses Flask. It takes an array and will pop off a random number in the array and return it. It uses an endpoint url so recieve information about an array. It finds the array by converting the data it receives into JSON format. Then it will look for the array (may have to chanve the name in line 11). It will then return the new array into JSON format.
